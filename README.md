# Force Plate Data Transmitter - ESP32 + ADS1220
Firmware for capturing and transmitting readings from ADS1220 ADCs with an Arduino-powered ESP32 (Adafruit's Huzzah32 to be precise)

Note: This is now an archival repo - this work has been expanded and incorporated into the Training Rig project as the digitisation tool for the ground-truth force sensor. Plate digitisation is done by the ADS1262.
