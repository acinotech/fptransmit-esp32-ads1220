# Force Plate Calibration Rig Firmware
Firmware for calibrating Acino force plates; designed to run on an ESP32 board (Adafruit's Huzzah32 to be precise).

## Related Hardware:
### Gantry:
- CAN-based comms to two T-Motor AK60-6 v1.1 motors for gantry actuation
- Four mechanical limit switches rigged up as endstops for the two axes
### Piston:
- A 160mm-bore pneumatic piston for force development
- Piston direction controlled by a solenoid-actuated 5/2 valve
- 4-20mA control of an Aventics Sentronic 609 pressure regulator to (indirectly) control the force generated by the piston
### Force Capture:
- A 3-axis Michigan Scientific TR3D-A 3-axis loadcell attached to the end of the piston for force ground truth
- SPI-based reading of ground truth force data from two ADS1220 ADCs (with 2 input channels each)
- Force digitisation from the plate is handled externally, and passed by serial / UART to the rig for time-synched capture
